# Rofi Ico Finder ï€Ž
This reduces the time consuming aspect of searching for an icon as a unicode character.

## Usage   
`./rofi_fa_ico_finder.sh`, then type your keywords, then "enter" then the symbol should be in your clipboard.   

## Requirements   
font-awesome installed on your machine (I am not sure about that...)   
rofi   
xclip   

## Internals

It works on a list generated with the python script in this repo taking the [awesome yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/master/src/icons.yml) of the font-awesome github repository into input. As a consequence, at the moment, only the characters supported by font-awesome is supported by this script. If you made a better list, pull it there :).
